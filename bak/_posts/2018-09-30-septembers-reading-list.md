Operating Systems:
- [Unix as IDE Series](https://sanctum.geek.nz/arabesque/series/unix-as-ide/). The article is pretty old, but I like the idea of thinking about OS as your IDE.

Machine Learning:
- [Machine Learning for Nginx Logs - Identifying Operational Issues with Your Website](https://www.elastic.co/blog/machine-learning-for-nginx-logs). How Elastic finds anomalies using machine learning.
- [Variational Autoencoders Explained](http://kvfrans.com/variational-autoencoders-explained/). A great explanation of variational autoencoders instead of dozens scientific papers.

API Design:
- [Prisma — Cloud Native GraphQL Database API Layer — Deep Dive](https://divu.in/prisma-deep-dive-3162dea2820c). The article is a good addition to any GraphQL book.
- [GraphQL: Group By and Aggregated Values](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/1312) Worth reading as an example of data aggregation using GraphQL. 

Containers:
- [The missing CI/CD Kubernetes component: Helm package manager](https://medium.com/@gajus/the-missing-ci-cd-kubernetes-component-helm-package-manager-1fe002aac680) What is Helm? Basic introduction.

Databases:
- [Column-Stores vs. Row-Stores: How Different Are They Really? ](http://db.csail.mit.edu/projects/cstore/abadi-sigmod08.pdf). The paper improves understanding of difference between colomn and row -oriented stores.

Golang
- [How a Go Program Compiles down to Machine Code](https://getstream.io/blog/how-a-go-program-compiles-down-to-machine-code/) The optimization techniques making Go compiler so fast.
